libhdfs3

*  Build Requirements

To build libhdfs3, the following libraries are needed.

* cmake (2.8+) from http://www.cmake.org/

* google protocol buffers from http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

* kerberos from http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/

* libuuid from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libuuid/

* libgsasl from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl/

To run code coverage tests, the following tools are needed.

* gcov (included in gcc distribution)

* lcov (tested on 1.9)            http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php

* Unit Tests

You can run unit tests with the command:

+---+
make unittest
+---+

libhdfs3 also includes a suite of functional tests.  To run these tests,
you will need a running hdfs instance to test against.  Then, you will need
to create a function test configuration file in
<<<$LIBHDFS3_HOME/test/data/function-test.xml>>>.  See
<<<$LIBHDFS3_HOME/test/data/function-test.xml.example>>> for an example
configuration file.

You can run functional tests with:

+---+
make functiontest
+---+

You can run code coverage tests with:

+---+
make ShowCoverage
+---+

The code coverage result will be placed at <<<$BUILD_DIR/CodeCoverageReport/index.html>>>.
